# Latana Coding Challenge

This is a coding challenge for Latana. The task was to build a carousel component. The component should match the overall design of the Latana website. I broke down the carousel component into smaller reusable components, carousel, carouselSlide, button and arrow. The content.json file contains information about the slides to display and can be altered accordingly. Depending on the screen size there will be three, two or one slide visible at a time. Breakpoints are currently set at 1342px for medium screens and 982px for small screens.
I am also using styled components and SCSS to style the carousel.
Thank you for your time and I hope you will enjoy it as much as I did.
